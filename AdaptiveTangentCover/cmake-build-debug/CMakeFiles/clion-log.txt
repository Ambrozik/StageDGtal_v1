CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:2 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindDGtal.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "DGtal", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "DGtal" with any of
  the following names:

    DGtalConfig.cmake
    dgtal-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "DGtal" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "DGtal_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "DGtal"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
